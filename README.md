##Git
Git will be the version control system used in Pumba.

###1.0 Install Git
####1.1 MacOS and Linux
Git is preinstalled on many Linux-distributions and MacOS sometimes have Git preinstalled. Write `git --version` in the terminal to verify that Git is installed. If Git was not installed, you should now get instructions in the terminal about how to install Git. Your Mac might ask you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools – do this, these tools contains Git.

####1.2 Windows
Windows does not have Git preinstalled. There are two alternatives to install Git in Windows:
- Git for Windows: Download and install Git for Windows https://gitforwindows.org. This is a terminal that contains all the Git functionality.
- Windows 10 Linux Subsystem: If you use Windows 10 you can install a Linux terminal in Windows that works just like a normal Linux terminal with all its features. This means that you can run Git, SSH, Docker etcetera from it. Search for Windows 10 Linux Subsystem for installation instructions.

###2.0 Get started
When you have installed Git you need to download the Pumba development git repository. In the terminal, go to the folder you want to download the project in. You could call this folder repos for example and clone the repository into that folder. Clone the repository with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/pumpumba/project_TBD.git`.

The first time you use Git it might ask you to set some information such as your name etcetera.
If you use the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem, make sure that you stand in a folder that is accessible by Windows.

This is what it could look like after getting started:

###3.0 Fundamental Git commands
`git clone <URL>` - Clone the project. This is usually done once per project.
`git status ` – See the status about what is going to be committed.
`git add <filename>` - Add a file to be committed.
`git add -u` – Add all files you have edited to be committed (does not include files you have just created or removed).
`git commit` – Commit the changes locally.
`git push` – Upload your local commit.
`git pull` – Download commits. Do this often so that you have the latest changes!
`git diff` – See what has been edited but not committed.
`git checkout <branchname>` – Change to another branch.
`git branch <branchname>` – Create a new branch.
`git stash` – Remove your own changes locally (and store them in a mysterious place locally). You could do this for example if you want to do a git pull but Git says that you have done changes locally and you want to throw away your local changes.

There are more commands. Look at this PDF for more info: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

###4.0 Git conflicts – TODO
Now and then Git conflicts will take place. This could happen if you want to git push but that somebody else has edited the same file and done a git push after that when you downloaded the file with git pull. This may feel unpleasant, but it is solvable quite easy.

###5.0 The Pumba Git-workflow – TODO
At the Pumba Github page one can see all the branches etcetera.
Do not add unnecessary files in the git repository, such as files with a name that starts with a dot etcetera.
